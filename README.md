# TopSkyGreece

Welcome to my project!

This is an adaptation of the TopSky Euroscope plugin for Greece and Cyprus!
In this profile I have included CPDLC & PDC functions.
Also the plugin itself provides RDF and Weather Radar!
I have also included my own Tags.txt file which is a modified version of the default KEPATH tag family with TopSky functions!

In order to properly use this profile take a quick look at the manuals which are included in the release!

To take advantage of the CPDLC and PDC capabilities of the plugin you should register at https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/register.html

You can change the values of the settings file to match your personal needs.

For any questions or suggestions relate to the delegated areas on Github!
