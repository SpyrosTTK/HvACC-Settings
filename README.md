# TopSkyGreece

Welcome to my project!

This is an adaptation of the TopSky Euroscope plugin for Greece and Cyprus!
In this profile I have included CPDLC, PDC and automated Squawk assignment functions.
Also the plugin itself provides RDF and Weather Radar!
I have also included my own Tags.txt file which is a modified version of the default KEPATH tag family with TopSky functions!

In order to properly use this profile take a quick look at the manuals which are included in the release!

To take advantage of the CPDLC and PDC capabilities of the plugin you should register at https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/register.html

For any questions regarding this profile relate to the Issues tab on GitHub!
